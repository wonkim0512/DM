CRASHING SURF.  The waves TOSS a BEARDED MAN onto wet sand. He lies there.  A CHILD\\'S SHOUT makes him LIFT his head to see: a LITTLE  BLONDE BOY crouching, back towards us, watching the tide eat  a SANDCASTLE. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the boy. The Bearded  Man tries to call them, but they RUN OFF, FACES UNSEEN. He  COLLAPSES.  The barrel of a rifle ROLLS the Bearded Man onto his back. A  JAPANESE SECURITY GUARD looks down at him, then calls up the  beach to a colleague leaning against a JEEP. Behind them is a  cliff, and on top of that, a JAPANESE CASTLE.  INT. ELEGANT DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - LATER  The Security Guard waits as an ATTENDANT speaks to an ELDERLY  JAPANESE MAN sitting at the dining table, back to us.                     ATTENDANT               (in Japanese)           He was delirious. But he asked for           you by name. And...               (to the Security Guard)           Show him.                     SECURITY GUARD               (in Japanese)           He was carrying nothing but this...  He puts a HANDGUN on the table. The Elderly Man keeps eating.                     SECURITY GUARD           ...and this.  The Security Guard places a SMALL PEWTER CONE alongside the  gun. The Elderly Man STOPS eating. Picks up the cone.                     ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN               (in Japanese)           Bring him here. And some food.  INT. SAME - MOMENTS LATER  The Elderly Man watches the Bearded Man WOLF down his food.  He SLIDES the handgun down the table towards him.                     ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN               (in English)           Are you here to kill me?  The Bearded Man glances up at him, then back to his food.                                                          2.  The Elderly Japanese Man picks up the cone between thumb and  forefinger.                    ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN          I know what this is.  He SPINS it onto a table- it CIRCLES gracefully across the  polished ebony... a SPINNING TOP.                    ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN          I\\'ve seen one before. Many, many          years ago...  The Elderly Japanese Man STARES at the top mesmerized.

What\\'s the most resilient parasite?                                                    CUT TO:INT. SAME ELEGANT DINING ROOM - NIGHT (YEARS EARLIER)The speaker, COBB, is 35, handsome, tailored. A youngJapanese man, SAITO, eats as he listens.                    COBB          A bacteria? A virus?Cobb gestures at their feast with his wine glass-                    COBB          An intestinal worm?Saito\\'s fork pauses, mid-air. Cobb GRINS. A third man is atthe table- ARTHUR. He jumps in to save the pitch-                    ARTHUR          What Mr. Cobb is trying to say-                     COBB          An idea.Saito looks at Cobb, curious.                                                3.                    COBB          Resilient, highly contagious. Once          an idea\\'s taken hold in the brain          it\\'s almost impossible to          eradicate. A person can cover it          up, ignore it- but it stays there.                    SAITO          But surely-to forget...?                    COBB          Information, yes. But an idea?          Fully formed, understood? That          sticks...              (taps forehead)          In there, somewhere.                    SAITO          For someone like you to steal?                    ARTHUR          Yes. In the dream state, conscious          defenses are lowered and your          thoughts become vulnerable to          theft. It\\'s called extraction.                    COBB          But, Mr. Saito, we can train your          subconscious to defend itself from          even the most skilled extractor.                    SAITO          How can you do that?                    COBB          Because I am the most skilled          extractor. I know how to search          your mind and find your secrets. I          know the tricks, and I can teach          them to your subconscious so that          even when you\\'re asleep, your guard          is never down.Cobb leans forwards. Holding Saito\\'s gaze.                    COBB          But if I\\'m going to help you, you          have to be completely open to me.          I\\'ll need to know my way around          your thoughts better than your          wife, your analyst, anyone.              (gestures around)          If this is a dream and you\\'ve got a          safe full of secrets, I need to          know what\\'s in that safe. For this          to work, you have to let me in.                                                            4.Saito gives this a flicker of a smile. Rises. A BODYGUARDopens double doors which give onto a LAVISH PARTY.                    SAITO          Gentlemen. Enjoy your evening as I          consider your proposal.They watch Saito leave. Arthur turns to Cobb, worried-                      ARTHUR          He knows.Cobb motions silence. A TREMOR starts, they steady theirglasses, Cobb glances at his watch- THE SECOND HAND ISFROZEN.                    ARTHUR          What\\'s going on up there?And we-                                                    CUT TO:FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)Cobb, ASLEEP, SITTING IN A CHAIR AT THE END OF A STEAMINGBATH. The chair is up on a cabinet- the bottom of the legslevel with the rim of the tub.A sweating man (40\\'s) watches over Cobb. This is NASH. Adistant EXPLOSION rumbles through the room. Nash moves to thewindow, parts the curtains. Outside: a CHAOTIC DEVELOPING-WORLDCITY- the street filled with RIOTERS- SMASHING, BURNING.Nash checks Cobb\\'s left wrist: above his watch, tape holdsTWO THIN YELLOW TUBES in place. Nash looks at Cobb\\'s watch-THE SECOND HAND CRAWLS UNNATURALLY SLOWLY.Nash follows the tubes to a SILVER BRIEFCASE at Arthur\\'sfeet: ARTHUR IS ASLEEP in an armchair. Tubes connect thebriefcase to Arthur\\'s wrist.Nash follows another set of tubes from the briefcase to wherethey pass under the door to the bedroom. Through the crack ofthe door, Nash sees SAITO ASLEEP on the bed, tubes running tohis wrist. BOOM- a closer EXPLOSION, and we-                                                    CUT TO:INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)Nash, ASLEEP.

Hechecks Nash\\'s wrist: TWO YELLOW TUBES CONNECT NASH WITH THREEOTHER SLEEPING MEN IN THE COMPARTMENT: COBB, ARTHUR, SAITO.Todashi checks his watch: THE SECOND HAND TICKS IN REAL TIME.Another TRAIN PASSES in the opposite direction with a MIGHTYWHUMP- Todashi\\'s eyes FLY to Nash\\'s sleeping face-NASH JERKS WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRAIN, and we-                                                     CUT TO:INT.

ROOFTOP TERRACES, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHTA LOW TREMOR RUMBLES THROUGH THE CASTLE. Cobb and Arthursteady themselves against the wooden rail. Several TILES andpieces of MASONRY fall. Below them a BLACK SEA churns. OtherGUESTS wander the massive terraces.                    ARTHUR          Saito knows. He\\'s playing with us.                    COBB          I can get it here. The          information\\'s in the safe- he          looked right at it when I mentioned          secrets.Arthur nods. Then spots someone over Cobb\\'s shoulder.                    ARTHUR          What\\'s she doing here, Cobb?Cobb turns to see a beautiful woman, elegantly dressed,staring out at the sea. This is MAL. Cobb watches her.                    COBB          You just get to your room. I\\'ll          take care of the rest.                    ARTHUR          See that you do. We\\'re here to          work.Arthur brushes past Mal, shaking his head. She nears Cobb.Looks out at the DROP. The WIND WHIPS HER HAIR-                    MAL          If I jumped, would I survive?                                                           6.                    COBB          With a clean dive, perhaps. Mal,          why are you here?She turns to look at him. Amused.                    MAL          I thought you might be missing          me...She smiles. He leans in, mesmerized.                    COBB          I am. But I can\\'t trust you          anymore.She stares up at him, inviting.                       MAL          So what?INT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATERMal sips champagne as she studies a painting by FrancisBacon.                    MAL          Looks like Arthur\\'s taste.Cobb is looking down through the window at the GUARDSpatrolling the castle at ground level.                    COBB          Actually, Mr. Saito is partial to          postwar British painters.He turns to Mal, donning a pair of black leather gloves.                    COBB          Would you sit down?Mal lowers herself gracefully into a leather wingback chair.Cobb approaches, pulls out a length of BLACK ROPE and kneelsat Mal\\'s feet. She looks down at him.                       MAL          Tell me...Cobb TIES the rope around the CHAIR LEGS.                    MAL          Do the children miss me?Cobb pauses. He lets his gloved fingers lightly touch Mal\\'sankle. He looks up at her.                                                            7.                    COBB          You can\\'t imagine.Mal looks away, uncomfortable. Cobb gets to his feet, lettingout the rope as he moves back to the window.                    MAL          What\\'re you doing?Cobb tosses the rope out-                    COBB          Getting some air.He tugs on the rope, testing.

You\\'ve got the cafe, the          layout... you forgot the book shop          but pretty much everything else is          here.Ariadne looks at the passers-by.                    ARIADNE          Who are the people?                                                        34.                    COBB          They\\'re projections of my          subconscious.                     ARIADNE          Yours?                    COBB          Sure-you are the dreamer, I am the          subject. My subconscious populates          your world. That\\'s one way we get          at a subject\\'s thoughts-his mind          creates the people, so we can          literally talk to his subconscious.                    ARIADNE          How else do you do it?                    COBB          Architecture. Build a bank vault or          a jail, something secure, and the          subject\\'s mind will fill it with          information he\\'s trying to protect.                    ARIADNE          Then you break in and steal it.                     COBB          Exactly.Ariadne wonders at the detail of the street.                     ARIADNE          I love the concrete sense of things-              (stamps foot)          Real weight, you know? I thought a          dream space would be all about the          visual, but it\\'s the feel of          things. Question is, what happens          as you start to mess with          physics...She CONCENTRATES on the street. The street starts to BEND INHALF- the buildings on either side FOLDING IN until they formthe INSIDE OF A CUBE OF CITY, GRAVITY FUNCTIONINGINDEPENDENTLY ON EACH PLANE. Ariadne looks up (or down) atthe people on the opposite city surface. Cobb watches herexcitement.                    ARIADNE          It\\'s something, isn\\'t it?                    COBB              (quiet)          Yes.

ARIADNE          Why are they looking at me?                    COBB          Because you\\'re changing things. My          subconscious feels that someone          else is creating the world. The          more you change things, the quicker          the projections converge on you.                      ARIADNE          Converge?                    COBB          They feel the foreign nature of the          dreamer, and attack-like white          blood cells fighting an infection.                    ARIADNE          They\\'re going to attack us?                    COBB          Just you, actually.They walk along the street to where it joins the nextgravitational plane. They step up onto the different planeand walk down the street towards a river. As Ariadneapproaches, steps emerge from the flagstone, and she leadsCobb up onto a small jetty. As she concentrates, pillarsemerge and a BRIDGE starts to telescope out from the jetty.They step onto it as it grows. Cobb is impressed.                    COBB          It\\'s beautiful... but if you keep          on changing things...People crossing the bridge STARE at Ariadne. Several of themBUMP her shoulder as they pass.                    ARIADNE          Mind telling your subconscious to          take it easy?                    COBB          That\\'s why it\\'s called subconscious.
